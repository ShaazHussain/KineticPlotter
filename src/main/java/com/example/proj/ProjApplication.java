//KineticPlotter is a dynamic web application designed to analyze and visualize chemical reaction kinetics.
//The application allows users to input concentration and time data directly through the web interface
//and provides powerful tools for calculating and predicting reaction rates and orders.
//With interactive plots and an intuitive interface, KineticPlotter helps students, educators, and
//researchers gain insights into reaction dynamics by visualizing  plots.

//Users can easily switch between different plots with a simple click for
//better understanding of the chemical processes.
//The application is built using Java for back-end computation and front-end visualization.
